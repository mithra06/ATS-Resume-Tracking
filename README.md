# ATS-Resume

In todayâ€™s job market, passing through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) is crucial for landing interviews. With that in mind, I developed a tool that helps job seekers analyze their resumes, optimize keyword usage, and ensure better ATS compatibility.

I have used tools like 
1. PyPDF2
2. Google-Gemini Pro
3. Streamlit
